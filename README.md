# Blast-Off - A modern alternative to hangman

This interactive front-end website has been developed to entertain space-enthusiasts whilst helping to grow and develop their space-ralated vocabulary through a challenging word-based game.

Blast-off is a modern twist on the good old fashioned, pen and paper based game Hangman.  Instead of slowly bringing an innocent stick-man to his untimely death by hanging, the user is challenged to guess a space-related word, letter-by-letter.  If the word is guessed correctly the rocket will blast-off into space, but if they get the answer wrong or run out of lives, the rocket will remain grounded.
