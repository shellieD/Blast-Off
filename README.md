# Blast-Off - A modern alternative to hangman

This interactive front-end website has been developed to entertain space-enthusiasts whilst helping to grow and develop their space-ralated vocabulary through a challenging word-based game.

Blast-off is a modern twist on the good old fashioned, pen and paper based game Hangman.  Instead of slowly bringing an innocent stick-man to his untimely death by hanging, the user is challenged to guess a space-related word, letter-by-letter.  If the word is guessed correctly the rocket will blast-off into space, but if they get the answer wrong or run out of lives, the rocket will remain grounded.

## UX - User Experience Design

### User Stories

The site's strategy us based on satisfying the below user stories:

As a user, when I load the website:-

* I want the purpose of the game to be apparent.
* I want the game to be easy to navigate.
* I want the game to be aesthetically pleasing and styled relevant to the nature of the game.
* I want to be able to control the sound, which I would like to be muted by default.
* I would like to be able to select the difficulty level of the game.

As a user, when I play the game:-

* I want each screen present to me to have consistent styling to the landing page.
* I want the controls to be easy to use and intuitive.
* I want to be able to keep score of the games I win and lose.
* I want to be able to reset the game.
* I want the game to be challenging.
* I want the game to have an element of fun.

### Initial Concept

This project has been developed as part of the [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net/) Diploma in Full-Stack Software Development.  The aim is to create a game that will demonstrate the skills I have learnt in HTML, CSS and Javascript

My idea for this game was to create an alternative version of the traditional pen-and-paper based game Hangman.  This game was to be based on space, and use space-themed vocabulary and include a fun animation of a rocket that would 'Blast-Off' if the user guessed the word correctly, or wobbled and tobbled over if the user used all lives and did not guess the word correctly.  I wanted to create a site that could fit on one screen, despite the device used, be intuitive to use and have a fun, retro feel about it.  

The target audiece I would say, would be for children from age 6 upwards, with families being able to sit together to play whilst tessting their spelling and increasing their space-related vocabulary.
